# Markdown Link Checker

This GitHub action checks all hyperlinks in Markdown files for broken links and reports their status. It's designed to be lightweight, fast, and compatible across different environments.

This line contains a [broken link](https://example.com/broken.html)

## Features

- Checks external URLs and reports HTTP status codes
- Validates internal file links and fragment references
- Supports checking image links
- Recursive directory scanning
- Configurable timeout and retry settings
- Detailed reporting of broken links

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```yml
name: Check Markdown links

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

  schedule:
    # Run weekly on Sundays
    - cron: "0 0 * * 0"

jobs:
  check-links:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:

```

### Advanced Usage

```yml
name: Check Markdown links

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  check-links:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Check Markdown Links
        uses: harryvasanth/markdown-link-checker@v1
        with:
          path: "docs"
          files: "README.md CONTRIBUTING.md" # space-separated
          exclude: "node_modules vendor" # space-separated
          recursive: "true"
          timeout: "15"
          retry-count: "3"

You can also use commas, or mix commas and spaces, for `files` and `exclude`:

```yml
with:
  files: "README.md,CONTRIBUTING.md"
  exclude: "node_modules,vendor"
```

or even

```yml
with:
  files: "README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md docs/guide.md"
  exclude: "node_modules, vendor dist"
```

## Configuration File

You can use a configuration file to set options for the link checker. Create a file (e.g., `.linkcheck.conf`) with the following format:

```conf
# Link Checker Configuration

PATH_TO_CHECK="docs"
EXCLUDE="node_modules vendor"
TIMEOUT=15
RETRY_COUNT=3
VERBOSE=true
```

Then reference it in your workflow:

```yml
- name: Check Markdown Links
  uses: harryvasanth/markdown-link-checker@v1
  with:
    config-file: ".linkcheck.conf"
```

## Output

The action will output information about the links it checks and any broken links it finds:

```console
